# Sensors for this project

Capacitive sensors work really well IF you insulate the copper from the rail.

Touching the rail and the copper gives a larger capacitance than only touching the copper.

## Looks

- Would be nice with very visible wires from the sensors to the computer
- The wires could go from the sensors, down the hole in the top of the structure in the pit and down into the hole in the pit.

## Speaker

Placement:
- At the bottom of the pit?
- On the structure, highly visible?
