noisy tesselation
¨¨.¨¨
“”
        ;
As we move on,
eternal growth - infinite
#
^^^
drifting into the night
decomposing,
a major leap
    in inattention
people’s ideas for inventions are constrained

                            blends in
people’s ideas for inventions are constrained
eclipsed within itself


what one is
...
it tends to never slow,
