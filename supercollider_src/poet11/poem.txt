the people are not
    either or
    i am defined
             my interface
             is a portal to me, to my being
not-yet-possible
remind me, i am my own!
                            blends in

it seeps into the 
                            blends in

             is a portal to me, to my being
this changes the direction

what one is
ripples through
        invisible
             my interface
