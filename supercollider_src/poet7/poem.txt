        ;
As we move on,
eternal growth - infinite
#
^^^
drifting into the night

a major leap
    in inattention
people’s ideas for inventions are constrained

                            blends in
eternal growth - infinite
eclipsed within itself
what is innovative anymore

what one is
...
it tends to never slow,
