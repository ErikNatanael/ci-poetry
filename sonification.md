# Sonification of the poem

- pyttsx can do TTS with eSpeak on Linux
- Bring the text into SuperCollider and put it through filters and delay networks based on the text of the poem.
- Each word is a sonification command.



# Actions

- Replace a random line with a random line from your poem

Start with 12 lines


# Sound

- ackord + arpeggion
- mjuka ljud, bakgrund mest
- mjuk klocka när man gör något som fejdar ut och så kommer dikten tillbaka som ljud > <
- dikten väldigt bakgrundig när ingen interagerar




Use only variations of the same major (or possibly minor) chord where notes are placed in different octaves.
Vary the amount of activity within the chord
Empty lines have only the root note


# Impressions from R1

- Needs a bit more variation in it's demo state (turn certain parts on or off?)
- Another soft variation sometimes
- TTS is too aggressive and too unclear, needs to blend more with the rest if we're gonna keep it

- Project the text with projector


# Trigger sounds

Longer sounds that die out, one per each sensor.
