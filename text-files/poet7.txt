As we move on,
discovery
new materials,
incomplete prototypes
not-yet-possible
peopleâ€™s ideas for inventions are constrained
a major leap
a stepping stone
what is innovative anymore
eternal growth - infinite
it tends to never slow,
this changes the direction
of the narrative of industrialization
what is behind this interface,
we occupy pixels on a screen
