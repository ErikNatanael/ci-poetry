Occupy/evacuate

waking up    ,
      reaching out
realising
      a life anew

struggling  ,
      to get past -
phone. 



remind me, i am my own!
something, occupy! 
turn to bother
    disappear
    in inattention


turn
      inside out
      outside in

notice nothing -
      notice not

become      ,


      lost.
