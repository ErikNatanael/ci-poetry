# Different poets

A "poet" in this instance is a generative automatic poet that writes and edits this collaborative poem.

## Additive poets (01 to 07)

- Adds a sentence somewhere in the middle of the poem (not first or last, but anywhere else) using only words that have already been used.
- Adds 4 extra words within random sentences.
- Adds 2 line breaks after a punctuation mark.
- Adds 1 line break within a sentence.
- Adds 2x4 spaces anywhere.

- Adds a noun after a different noun. The nouns have to be close in association.

## Subtractive poets (08 to 12)

- Removes 2 random words (not including punctuation).
- Removes a sentence from the beginning of the poem.

## Rules for determining if the poem passes or fails
